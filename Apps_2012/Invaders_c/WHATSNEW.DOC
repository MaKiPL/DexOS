Version 1.1 - September 17, 1995

- Invaders would stop shooting on the higher levels - FIXED.

  - I discovered this one during a paricularily good game at school during
    class [snicker].

    A number is picked at random, and if it is 2, one of the invaders is
    selected to fire. The number picked is the shot frequency, which is
    decreased every level. Eventually, it reaches 2, which is the maximum
    frequency (the random number 2 shows up every time, and the invaders
    fire constantly).

    Unfortunately, the number gets decreased below this value to 0, selecting
    a random number between 0 and 0, thus 2 never shows up, and the invaders
    stop shooting. It was a simple fix.

- Time reset to midnight during game play - FIXED.

  - I can't believe I didn't notice this! Dumb dumb dumb!
    Thanks to Patrick A Springman for mentioning this one to me.

    The game uses the real time clock for simple timing of the title
    screen delays, printing delays, etc. When the game uses this timer,
    it reset the timer to 0, then watched it until it reached a particular
    value. The problem is, resetting this timer to 0 also resets the clock
    to midnight.

    The time change wasn't a permanent change. Once the machine was rebooted,
    the timer is reinitialized with the CMOS clock value, and everything
    returns to normal, but it was annoying anyway.

    The game no longer adjusts the timer, rather it reads the current time
    into a variable, adds the delay value to that variable, then watches
    the timer until it reaches this calculated time.

    It's better, but does cause some time inconsistancies. Mostly with the
    amount of delay the title screens are displayed for - It doesn't seems to
    affect the game play timing (as expected).

- Added high score functions, and rearranged title screens so score is always
  visible.
